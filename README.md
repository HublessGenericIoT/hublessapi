## The API Definition

  id: //uuid that identifies the device.
  name: //human readable name of the device.
  room: //room that the device is in.
  user: //user that the device belongs to. (Currently this is >1 for a user device and 0 for a testing device.)
  type: //the class of device. enum{LIGHT, ...} Currently not supported.
  attributes: {
    //an arbitrary set of attributes attached to the device.
    //currently unsupported, but will be stored in dynamo.
  }
  shadow: {
    //data returned from getDeviceShadow. See AWS API for details.
  }
}
````

### /devices

#### POST

        "nextToken": "" //paging token.
    }

    status: "Success|Error",
    payload: {} //a single device, as defined above.
}

#### PUT

````
{
  //a device (with or without the id, but if given, the id must match)
  //the device referred to in the url will be updated to match what is given.
